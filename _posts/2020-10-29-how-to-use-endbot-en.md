EndBot is a Discord Bot based on discord.py made by Tim23. This bot has many various commands.
Moderation, Music, Utility, Minigame, Webpage Scrap, Stats, it has many categories of commands, too! Of course there are more commands!

### Setup

**EndBot is available at DM Channels, but not all commands work like other bots.**
1. Go to [EndBot Invite Link](http://gg.gg/endbot). It will redirect to the invite link. You can custom the permissions by checking the roles!
Even though you invite the bot, you can change the permissions by going to `Server Settings` > `Role` > `EndBot`!

2. If you are not an administrator of a server, you can ask someone who has `Manage Server` Permission! There can be an administrator of the server,

It is pretty much it of setting up the bot.

It will look like this when you invite the bot.

**There are so much commands in EndBot! I wanna use only the MUSIC commands.**
It's okay! You can check the music commands with no other commands with `>help Music` or at HERE!
